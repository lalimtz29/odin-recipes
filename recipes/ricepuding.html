    <h1> Old-Fashioned Rice Pudding</h1>
     <img src="../recipeimages/ricepudding.webp"> 

 <p>This Old-Fashioned Rice Pudding tastes just like the KozyShack Rice Pudding I like to buy at the 
    grocery store, only better since it is made from all natural ingredients. This is a stove-top version
     with just the right amount of sweetness. Only 1/2 cup of sugar is added and most of the sweetness 
     comes from the milk cooking down.</p>
