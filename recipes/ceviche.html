    <h1> The Best Ceviche Recipe</h1> 
    <img src="../recipeimages/ceviche.jpeg"> 

    <p>The easy ceviche recipe is surprisingly very fast and simple to whip up and makes for a tasty, fun appetizer for
         parties and gatherings. Plus, it’s low-carb, gluten-free and low-fat – all great things to consider when serving 
         a crowd. I also love this served over greens or tucked into a tortilla for a light and healthy meal.</p>
         
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p> <ul> 
            <li> Fresh wild ocean fish (red snapper, tilapia, Corvina, sea bass, mahi-mahi, halibut, dorado, or Shrimp) </li>
             <li> lime juice</li> 
             <li>red onion</li> 
             <li>tomato</li>
    </ul></p> 
    
    <p> <h3>Steps</h3>
         <p> <ol>
             <li>Slice the onions and place in a bowl. Add the salt and lime juice and let these marinate while you continue- this
                 will help remove the bitterness from the onion.</li>
             <li> Cut the fish into 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch cubes and toss them 
                with the marinating onions.</li>
             <li>Add the remaining ingredients- cucumber, tomatoes and cilantro and give a good
                toss. If adding avocado, wait until serving to add it. </li>
             <li>Refrigerate for 45-60 minutes. The longer you let the fish cure in the marinade, t he more “cooked” through the ceviche will become. I find 45 minutes is perfect.
    </li> </ol>
